                    <h1>What we stand for at Bartcoin</h1>
                    <p>In 2020, a team of innovative economists, developers, psychologists, politicologists and philosophers came together to compose a plan for a brighter future: a future where all people could prosper, a future that knows no poverty, a future that serves all our families. At one of the meetings, a member of the committee brought up an idea that is now at the core of our organisation. He said that to improve our world, the current boundaries need to be broken, by using the contemporary and prospective technological powers that we have at our disposal.</p>
                    <p>This very proposal led to the philosophy that we stand by today, and some time later in 2020, to the creation of the world’s first digital currency, known as Bartcoin. The core task of Bartcoin, is to secure a future for humanity to-be. The committee therefore spends a lot of time delivering humanitarian aid, invests in green, reusable technology and tries to shape a world where a hydrogen economy is possible.</p>
                    <p>At Bartcoin, we believe in stewardship. We humans are responsible to keep this world as beautiful as it is today. By buying Bartcoin, you support a livable world for your family, but also for all other families that share this biosphere. You support innovation. You support a better world.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>The Bartcoin-team</p>

                    <h1>The Future of BartCoin (now, 2030, and beyond)</h1>
                    <p>After the conception of BartCoin in 2021, investors are often wondering about what our cause will achieve in the future. Our plans are enormous, and we are putting dozens of man-hours in making as much progress as possible. We believe that the future of BartCoin has a lot to offer.</p>
                    <p>BartCoin has rapidly entered the market in 2020 as one of the leading semi-tradable digital currencies. Because of it’s highly sufficient internal digital technology and highly educated team, it is a guarantee that BartCoin will remain a safe and trustable investment for your money.</p>
                    <p>Our goals vary between short- and long-term. In the short term, our goal is to responsibly and socially turn BartCoin into a widespread digital currency from which everyone can benefit. No matter your income; BartCoin will be the right choice for your family. In the long term, we want to help the world reach the goals set by the UN in the Sustainable Development Summit, which took place at the UN-headquarters in New York in september 2015.</p>
                    <p>After this goal, our next target is to create a fully functional space agency, with the goal to invest money in prospective space technology. The future of humanity, is a future in the cosmos. We want to support current initiatives to colonize Mars and the orbits of any planets in reach. Our goal is to be able to have self-sufficient space colonies, meaning that they are not dependent on earth.
                    After these goals have been inevitably achieved, we won’t stop. We will keep putting the effort in, to create a better living space. A real-life utopia is within range, as long as we won’t stop trying to reach it.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>The Bartcoin-team</p>
